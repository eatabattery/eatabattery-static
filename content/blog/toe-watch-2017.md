DAY 42 My big toe throbs, the knuckle aches. If I had known yankee candles were so dangerous I never would have let one fall on my big toe from the top of a tv when I wasn't looking. The nail has put up a good fight so far, but with the blood receding I'm starting to lose faith. The nail is cracking, water floods the lower levels of the nail after every shower now. The wound smells like almonds. The future is grim.
